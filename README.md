## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Bash**: This application is built using Bash scripts, so you will need a Unix-like environment (Linux or macOS). If you're on Windows, consider using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- **Tree Command**: This tool will help you visualize the directory structure. You can install it using your package manager:
  - For Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install tree`
  - For macOS: `brew install tree`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>

2. **Run the Setup Script**: Execute the setup script to create the necessary directories and files.
chmod +x create_environment.sh
./create_environment.sh

3. **Provide Your Name**: When prompted, enter your name. This will create a personalized submission reminder directory.


## Running the Application

1. **Navigate to Your Directory**: Change into your submission reminder directory.

cd submission_reminder_<your_name>

2. **Execute the Startup Script**: Run the startup script to initiate the reminder process.
./startup.sh

3. **View Output**: The application will display information about your assignments and remind you of any submissions that are due.

## How It Works

The application reads from a submissions file that contains details about students and their assignment statuses. It checks for any assignments that have not been submitted and provides reminders accordingly.
